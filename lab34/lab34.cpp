/***************************************************
Sum of numbers 
Write a program that reads in positive integers from the user, each separated by a space, 
and the whole terminated by a negative number (e.g. 3 22 10 -2),and outputs the sum 
of the numbers entered (notincluding the terminated negative number!).

           // add in to the sum
