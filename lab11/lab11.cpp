/* Start the program.
The computer must choose a number between 0 and 55 including 0 and 55.
The randomly chosen number is stored and the computer remembers it.
The program asks for user input to type a number between 0 and 55. Then press ENTER.
The computer compares the input number to the stored number.
If input number is lower than stored number, output "higher".
If input number is higher than stored number, output "lower".

If input number differs from stored number in any way, deduct 1 from score counter.
If input number is the same as stored number, output "You Win!"
If score counter reaches 0 or the output "You Win!" is displayed, output "You Lose. Would you like to try again?"
User is asked to input "y" for yes or "n" for no.
If "y" then then the program starts over.
